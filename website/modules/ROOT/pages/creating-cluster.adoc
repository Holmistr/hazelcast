= Creating a Cluster

You can use the following command on your terminal/command line
to start a standalone Hazelcast member while you are in the extracted directory:

[source,shell,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Linux
----
sh bin/start.sh
----

[source,shell,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Windows
----
bin/start.bat
----

[source,shell,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Docker
----
docker run hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION
----

Now you have a 1-member cluster. To add one more member to the cluster,
open another terminal/command line and rerun the above command. The members
discover each other automatically and form a 2-member cluster. Note that these
members are started with the default configuration, i.e., `hazelcast.xml` located
at the `bin` directory.
